Here we see that the intercept, vehicle length and ground clearance will most likely provide non-random data. Their p-values are less than .05%. Similarly the p-value for the summary is 5.35e-11, much lower than our significance level. We can assume that our slope is non-zero. Our R-squared value for this model is .7149, meaning there is a 71.49% probability that this method can accurately predict the mpg of prototype cars. This is a connection and we can confidently use this data to predict results.
